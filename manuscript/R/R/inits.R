# DEMOGRAPHY
# r = br-dr (0.09 - 0.5), K = carrying capacity (25000)
# gamma = density dependence = r/K, 0.015-0.25 (0.0009-0.004 Kitala)
br = 0.42 # 0.42-1
dr = 0.33 # 0.33-0.5

gamma = (br-dr)/K

# DISEASE
# mu = 1/inc. period: 12.44-18 (12.47 C&D95)
# alpha = disease induced mortality: 63-73 (64 C&D95), 118 for SD!

beta = R0*((mu+br)*(alpha+br))/(mu*K)    # beta = ~14-80/yr, or 0.0015/wk,
# beta = R0*alpha/N # for FD transmission beta varies with N - so at N = 1000, get beta = 0.15

# CONTROL
vr <- 0     # vaccination rate;
il <- 0.4  	# loss of immunity from vaccination
# rho_delay = delay before vaccination,
# vac_res = No. vaccines issued/ rabies case

# The key parameters that change the period of epidemics are:
# 1) as R0 inc, period decreases (at R0 --> 1.2 cycles lost)
# 2) as br inc, period decreases (K or gamma density dependence has no effect)
# 3) as incubation period increases, period increases (but only slightly)
